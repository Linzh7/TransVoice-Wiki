-- If you plan to copy and use the whole project as a starting point to make and host an
-- equivalent wiki, please ask permission; we're open to new information, and don't want
-- to have lots of "the same wiki but slightly different" competing with eachother without
-- communicating and improving resources. If you feel the need to copy the whole project
-- and modify some sections of it, the chances are that we would more appreciate your
-- contributions to this project. This is a request and not a legal demand, as the license
-- allows any use or modifications so long as the license file is included unmodified.
-- Just keep in mind that the quality of voice resources depends on open and free
-- communication of information between communities. The more we have people with
-- different pedagogy and ideas communicate, the more improvements we can make to
-- overall voice resource quality.
