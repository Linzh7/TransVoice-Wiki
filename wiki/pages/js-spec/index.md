# In-Site Spectrogram
There is a js based spectrogram made by Sumi included in the site. It can be found below:

<span class="fs-8">
[Open the spectrogram](/spectrogram){: .btn .btn-green }
</span>

## How To Read a Spectrogram
[See explaination here](https://sumianvoice.github.io/wiki/pages/other-resources/spectrograms.html)


## Pitch floor
You can set a pitch floor by specifying a minimum pitch (in Hz) which will cause the program to beep annoyingly whenever the sound drops below the set value.
