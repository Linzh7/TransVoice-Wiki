## Gendered patterns

Typical behaviours associated with feminine voices:
1. higher range of intonation
2. use of tempo to vary speech
3. emphasis with high pitch intonation
4. (not always) vocal creak (not fry) at the end of speech segments 

Typical behaviours associated with masculine voices:
1. intonation is more stable and less range
2. not much tempo change
3. use of vocal weight and volume for emphasis
4. sometimes downward intonation often into vocal fry 

## Example
A random example of intonation just to show how different it can be.

## Use of emotive phrases to train intonation and emphasis
You can use an emotive phrase to get into the 'character' of the voice you're going for. Choose something that you can really overact, you can always dial it back later.

- I can't believe they said that!
- Oh my god that is so cute I love it!
- What!? Why would you say that!?
- Uhhhg I can't believe this is taking so long. Get on with it already!
- I'll take two donuts. Actually, why not, I deserve it! I'll take six.
- Where did you get that dress? It's beautiful!
