# Getting Started
Usually, the recommendation is to start by lowering [vocal weight](Vocal Weight). Getting to a higher pitch with lower weight makes a significant difference already.
It's important to be aware at every stage of the possibility of falling into bad habits so keep in mind what can go wrong in each exercise.

Below is a typical plan assuming a typical masculine voice trained to be feminine. This isn't always accurate because everyone's different but it can give some direction to start.

## Lower weight and raise pitch
- avoid breathiness or going too light, avoid m2 / falsetto

## Raise resonance as needed
- avoid FVF constriciton (old man / old woman voice)
- when going out of an unvoiced slide, do so fluidly, avoid pauses that can let you reset to a lower larynx position
- clean the sound up before using it. Don't use a configuration that is rough, make it smooth first even at the cost of lowering resonance slightly

## Practice speech patterns
- avoid emphasis with volume for feminine voices
- vary tempo
- intonation doesn't need to be super high, but it's worth practicing

## Clean up the voice

If you're at this stage and you have any roughness in your voice, now's the time to sort it out. Going further will make it extremely difficult to unlearn later

- reduce breathiness
- practice lighter onsets with glottal strikes
- learn FVF retraction
- identify sources of tension and eliminate them
- find or create your strategically lazy configuration

## Get more pitch range
- at first this means just using the voice at a higher pitch sometimes to stretch your range. Fatigue is normal, but strain is to be avoided. If tension in neck persists for more than a few seconds after stopping speech, then you should rest and reevaluate your methods
- using m2 and making it stronger (sometimes called mix voice) is a good quick way to get tons of extra range
- practice intonating progressively higher

## Learn belting to be able to shout
- know what pressed phonation / hyperaduction sounds like and DON'T DO IT.
- don't just do an ah vowel, do harder ones like eh
- slowly reduce weight at your highest note in order to go even higher (will probably break at first)

## Start mimicry
- find a clip of a voice that is close to yours
- put a beep sound at the beginning for timing
- practice speaking over it as it plays and also listening and copying
