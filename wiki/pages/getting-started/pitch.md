# How Important is Pitch?
Very! But, not how you think.

There is a big misconception that pitch is a big or even the only reason masculine and feminine voices are different. There are a whole bunch of features that differ between a masculine and a feminine voice, and in fact, pitch isn't really in the equation at all.

Pitch is not a gendered factor. On its own it does not modify the gender presentation of a voice. In fact, there are plenty of voices as low as 120hz or even 90hz that are unmistakably feminine and voices as high as 250hz that are unmistakably masculine. Pitch as a part of your voice is basically not important.


## So in what way _is_ it important?
Put simply, a lot of exercises use pitch as a method of changing other factors. When we go up in pitch we usually lower [vocal weight](/wiki/pages/vocal-weight), which is useful in a pitch slide. So in essence, while pitch is not important to the way a voice is perceived, it _is_ important to the way we train our voices.

## Why low pitch voices are hard
So then, why is a low pitch voice so hard to do if pitch isn't important? Well the short answer is [microbehaviours](/wiki/pages/microbehaviours). Tiny subconscious things we do that make up the way we speak and produce tone. When we go to a lower pitch our configuration can be so fragile that it breaks up completely, or we cover up the lack of coordination with things like [breathiness](/wiki/pages/clarity/breathiness). Even if we manage to keep our configuration together, the subtle ways we make the voice bright and feminine will be harder to achieve when already trying so hard to keep things together. As soon as we add intonation, tempo changes and other [speech patterns](/wiki/pages/speech-patterns) the microbehaviours / glottal behaviours fall apart.
