## The fundamental laws of voice training
1. The more you use a configuration the more consistent it will become
2. The further you train a part of your voice, the more you will be able to let it rest almost as far as you trained it
3. Almost everything is exploratory, and most of the rest is habit, so the more things you try to do, the more things you will be able to do
4. The more you do something, the better you can do it and the more you will tend to do it subconsciously in future

So the most tenable strategy is:

1. Do practice in the direction of the things you want
2. Push things slightly past where you want them to be so they become comfortable where you want them to be
3. Explore things in opposite directions to where you want to be, to get more mastery

As well, there is this process that can be used to do more or less of a certain voice modification:

1. Try to do less of it
2. Try to do more of it
3. Try to isolate it so you don't change anything else
