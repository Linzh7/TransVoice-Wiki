# Resonance

## What is Resonance
Every space has a resonance frequency. When a sound passes through that space, frequencies near the resonance frequency of the space are highlighted. You can hear this when you blow air across the lip of a bottle. The more water (and thus less air) there is the higher the pitch of the whistle sound produced. 

## Exercises

### Big Dog Small Dog
1. Imitate a big dog panting
2. Try to imitate a smaller and smaller dog, raising the 'pitch' (it's not actually pitch) of the whisper
3. Make a normal voiced sound (not a whisper) at a set pitch like 200hz or G3 or whatever you like
  - avoid going too high in pitch
