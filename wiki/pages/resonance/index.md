# Resonance
## What is Resonance
Every space has a resonance frequency. When a sound passes through that space, frequencies in the sound near the resonance frequency of the space are highlighted. You can hear the resonance frequency when you blow air across the lip of a bottle. The more water (and thus less air) there is the higher the pitch of the whistle sound produced. Your vocal tract is similar to this.

Think of the larynx as the level of water in the bottle. The higher the larynx, the higher the resonance. When in voice, an area that is highlighted because of a resonance frequency is called a formant.


## Formants
Formants are areas of the voice that are highlighted because of the shape of the vocal tract. There are three formants we really care about.

0. First, and while it isn't a formant itself, F0. F0 is your pitch, and it's the fundamental frequency of your voice at any time.
1. F1 is primarily thought to be a consequence of larynx position along with a few other factors
2. F2 is primarily thought to be a consequence of mouth space

When we make different vowels, we move our mouth to change these formants so that the space between them is different, and that's how we can tell what vowel someone is saying. Try saying "hat" and "hoot". Notice one sounds brighter and one darker. In "hoot" we make the mouth longer by pushing the lips out slightly, and so more space and longer tube = lower resonance.

The following two sounds are at the same pitch (fundamental / F0), but at drastically different resonances. Larynx height isn't the only thing changing here, but it has the most impact.

## Exercises

### Big Dog Small Dog
1. Imitate a big dog panting
2. Try to imitate a smaller and smaller dog, raising the 'pitch' (it's not actually pitch) of the whisper
3. Make a normal voiced sound (not a whisper) at a set pitch like 200hz or G3 or whatever you like
  - avoid going too high in pitch
