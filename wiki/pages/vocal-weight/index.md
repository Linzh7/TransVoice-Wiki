## What is vocal weight?
Vocal weight is essentially a way of describing the amount of force with which the vocal folds interact. Think of it like clapping your hands together. You can vary the speed your hands travel and this causes the sound to increase in volume. You could also tense the muscles in your hands so that when they do hit they have a more sudden and thus louder interaction. The vocal folds are doing a similar thing. Since it's one of the most important and fundamental aspects of voice it's super useful to have good control over it.

Normally you might not affect vocal weight consciously at all, but there are ways to induce a change in it. Imagine you're clapping slowly as we described earlier. Now increase the rate with which you clap - as you go faster and faster you can't put as much force into it and so the force of each clap is lower. This is similar to the effect of low vocal weight. When we go up in pitch, the vocal folds are vibrating with a higher frequency, so of course, it's natural that the vocal weight tends to decrease when going to higher pitches, particularly when we don't try to force it and stay relaxed. This is the reason why pitch slides are such a great exercise for vocal weight.

It's important however to be aware that pitch is not the only way to affect weight. You can isolate it and get low weight at a low pitch for example or high weight at a high pitch. This extra control is very important - not only does it prevent us from accidentally slipping into another configuration but it allows us to progress faster and expand our range for this aspect more.

### Gender perception of vocal weight

* Low vocal weight ➡️ ♀️
* High vocal weight ➡️ ♂️

### Generalisations about vocal weight (not assured)

* When getting louder I drop in pitch and don't add air - heavier weight
* When getting louder I raise in pitch and add air - lighter weight

## Loudness vs vocal weight
A lot of people conflate the volume of your speech with vocal weight. Vocal weight is louder, but that doesn't mean all loud things are high in vocal weight. Yelling/shouting (rather than just speaking loudly) typically induces three things:

* raise in pitch
* increased airflow (and often increased closure)
* increased vocal weight

These can be isolated or removed from the equation. You can get loud without going up in pitch, or without increasing airflow or any combination. Some people go quiet when trying to achieve low vocal weight and then never learn control over it properly. It's important to 'stretch' in every direction (within reason) and to avoid relying on something for your voice to work!


## Exercises
### Pitch Slides
Pitch slides are a good way to reduce vocal weight. As you go up in pitch, the folds thin and vibrate at a higher rate, which decreases the amount of force involved in phonation. You can use pitch then to induce low vocal weight and then learn to control it independently of pitch.

The exercise itself looks like this:

Pitch slides are generally the best way to reduce vocal weight, but we can also induce low vocal weight in some other ways, although they have drawbacks.

### Yawning Exercise
One way is to yawn. Usually people yawn with low vocal weight and low resonance, so we can use this to see what low vocal weight sounds like for us. Some people have a tendency to abduct (go breathy) so it's important to be aware of this and reduce the breathiness if there is any. Here's an example:

### Vocal weight gradients

### Volume isolated gradients

### Using the 'sh' sound to control airflow amount

/[Experimental/] Using the 'sh' sound to control airflow amount and then the 'dj' (like in jam) to go into voiced while still controlling airflow. This can be used to show the difference between heavy and light vocal weight. I wouldn't recommend it for reducing vocal weight but it might be useful for isolating airflow volume vs vocal weight and pressed phonation.
