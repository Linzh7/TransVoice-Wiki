## FVF, False Vocal Folds and constriction
- "white noise" quality in background is louder and may be present even when not breathy
- increased subharmonics
- sometimes a "rattle" like quality is heard, which is essentially really high frequency harmonics up around 10kHz
- bad for vocal health in the long term

## OPC, Oropharyngeal Closure
- raises resonance by decreasing the width of the back of the mouth
- affects formants F1 and F2
- associated with loli voice and some "anime" voices, hyperfem, "small" voices

## Twang, AES constriction
- at the cost of buzziness (not vocal weight), adds the impression of high resonance
- increases the impression of brightness
- seen in some country singers, some Australian accents
- often induces hypernasality

## Formant, F1 F2 R1 R2 etc
- these are resonance peaks in the voice, caused by the shape of your vocal tract
- the ratio between F1 and F2 determines vowel
- F1 is considered a larynx caused feature
- F2 is considered a mouth caused feature
- F3 is from the difference in size between the mouth and the space between the teeth, mostly between the teeth and tongue
- F4 is from the same but lips

## SOVTEs, VFEs
- ?vfe and ?sovte for info
- semi occluded vocal tract exercises or vocal function exercises (often used interchangeably)
- helps give a baseline for airflow and glottal behaviour to an extent
- helps warmup and warmdown the voice to help with vocal health and fatigue

## Tongue Root Retraction or lowering
- has a goofy, dark sound
- associated with Meatwad
- can sometimes happen unintentionally with people doing OPC

## Glottal Behaviour
- covers all behaviours to do with phonation
- vocal weight, pitch, closure, FVF, subglottal pressure, onsets, and microbehaviours are all under this umbrella
- a catch all term for how the voice is produced
- has a lot to do with [clarity](/wiki/pages/clarity) and tone purity / [HNR](#harmonic-to-noise-ratio-hnr)

## Subharmonics
- rough quality similar to creak/fry
- extra harmonics appear, one in between each other harmonic, essentially making it as if the pitch was halved
- can be a sign of slight FVF constriction interfering

## Harmonic to Noise Ratio (HNR)
HNR is the description of essentially how noisy a voice is. We have harmonics - which are the horizontal lines in the image - and then there's noise in between, either from constriction, breathiness or a combination. You can see in the image how there is a clean looking pattern on the left, and a noisy one on the right. This could be called the 'clarity' of the voice, though it refers specifically to noise and not things like nasality or knodel effects which might make a voice sound 'out of place'.

Primary sources of low Harmonic to Noise ratio:
    ・abduction (breathiness)
    ・FVF constriction
    ・vocal fry and creak

## Breath Support
- low support voices are typically unstable and fluctuate in pitch uncontrollably, may flip between m1 and M2 unpredictably
- high support voices are more robust
- putting a fair bit of pressure into the /s/ sound can induce better support
- M2 and quiet voices tend to be low in support without training

## TA Muscles
The following is assuming TA muscle is the thing responsible for what we see, but it could be something else in which case replace TA with whatever is actually doing the work. TA seems to be involved though and it's unlikely to be anything else.
- thyroarytenoid muscles, running the length of the vocal folds
- more activation = more weight and then typically into pressed phonation when pushed too far
- can make M2 not sound like M2 and be more stable and bright rather than the "too thin" or hollow quality M2 usually has
- can help with more general (not breath specifically) support to the voice to make it more robust
- can blend m1 and M2 to avoid breaks and more reliably come back into m1 from a slide
- a component of "shouting posture"

## Hypernasality / Nasality
- too much passage of air through the nose when phonating
- darkens the sound and works as an antiformant
- makes F1 and F2 almost nonexistant
- can make vocal weight less prominent at higher pitches
- nasal sounds should be the only muffled sounds when the nose is pinched, so you can read ?non-nasal passages to test for it

## Hyponasality
- too little passage of air through the nose when phonating

## Open Quotient
- related to low [vocal weight](/wiki/pages/vocal-weight)

## Closed Quotient
- related to high [vocal weight](/wiki/pages/vocal-weight)

## Larynx
- houses the vocal folds
- can be raised to get a brighter sound
- the 'adam's apple' is outside of the thyroid cartilage, part of the larynx

## Register
- see below

## [Laryngeal Vibratory Mechanism](/wiki/pages/other-resources/mechanisms)
- describes how and how much of the vocal folds vibrates

### M0 - Vocal Fry
- also known as
  - pulse
  - strohbass
  - fry
- is at the bottom of your range
- sounds like an idling motorcycle

### M1 - Modal voice
- your normal speaking register

### M2 - Falsetto / Head Voice
- high pitch, often hollow register
- can be made less hollow with [strong M2](/wiki/pages/pitch-range/strong-m2)

### M3
- whistle register

## [Resonance](/wiki/pages/resonance)
- changes the timbre or non-pitch qualities of a voice
- is dependent on the size and shape of the vocal tract

## Phonate
- verb: to produce a tone by making the vocal folds vibrate
- requires both closure (adduction) and airflow

## Placement (?)
- to be added

## Embouchure
- loosely describes resonance changes in the mouth

## Vocal Tract
- the mouth, nose, larynx and pharynx; everything from the larynx up

## AES/Aryepiglottic Sphincter
- associated with twang
