## Getting a clip to mimic
- identify an aspect of voice you want to change or a voice you want to have
- find an example of that voice quality that is at a similar pitch and not too far out of your resonance range
- make sure it's not too fast, or it will be harder to mimic
- get a 2-5 second clip, just a short phrase of about 5-10 words, cut it from the clip and add a beep at the beginning

## Mimicry 101
- the reason mimicry works is that it lets your subconscious figure stuff out intuitively so don't overanalyse
- try to copy all speech patterns
- get into the character, expect their voice to come out of your mouth and believe it 100%, don't just hope, believe.
- do a combination of two methods:
    * dub over the clip as it's playing in real time
    * listen to a clip, and while listening mouth the words but don't speak, then once it's finished try to do your best impression

## Benefits of mimicry
- helps you learn speech patterns
- if you find your self perception is negative, it can help you get a voice that sounds 'less like you'
