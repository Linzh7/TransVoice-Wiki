# Onsets
Onsets are the attack of the sound, and when the attack is harsh it's called a hard onset. A soft onset is when there is less of a _burst_ on the start of phonation and the volume is consistent across the whole sound.

There are three main types of onset.
1. hard onset
2. soft onset
3. aspirate onset
