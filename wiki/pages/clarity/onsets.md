# Onsets
Onsets are the attack of the sound, and when the attack is harsh it's called a hard onset. A soft onset is when there is less of a _burst_ on the start of phonation and the volume is consistent across the whole sound. Aspirate onsets instead start breathy and slide into phonation.

There are three main types of onset.
1. hard onset
2. soft onset
3. aspirate onset

Hard onset:

Soft onset:

Aspirate onset:

## Hard onsets
Hard onsets have a sudden attack and often are slightly louder than the rest of the sound.

These can sound harsh, and also have a tendency to bring out heavy vocal weight.

## Soft onsets
Soft onsets have either a sudden attack or a slight ramp and are consistent with the rest of the sound.

These are usually a little cleaner sounding than hard onsets.

# Aspirate onsets
Aspirate onsets start breathy and then go to phonation. "Haa" is an aspirate onset.

These typically are associated with breathiness.
