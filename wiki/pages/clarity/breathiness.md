# Breathiness
When the vocal folds come apart (abduction) and air is able to rush through without helping the folds vibrate, we get some turbulence, and that is expressed as noise - breathiness. Adduction is the opposite, where the folds are pressed more together.

The state of adduction vs abduction is called closure.

```
Abduction : folds further apart - your vocal folds get _taken away_ from earth by aliens
Adduction : folds closer together - the aliens _add_ your vocal folds back to earth

Closure : the amount of air that's used in speech vs the amount of air that gets let through
```

If we add too much closure we get [hyperadduction](/wiki/pages/various/hyperadduction).

If we add too little closure we get breathiness.


## Effects of breathiness
Apart from sounding whisper-like and being slightly out of place, breathiness can hide vocal weight (which is not a good thing) and makes it harder to train most characteristics. It also darkens the voice, as seen below.
