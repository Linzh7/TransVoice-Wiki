# Hyperadduction
Don't do hyperadduction.

## What hyperaduction sounds like
Non-hyperadducted:
<audio controls> <source src="/audio/tone-masc-normal.ogg" type="audio/ogg"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio>
Hyperadducted:
<audio controls> <source src="/audio/tone-masc-hyperadducted.ogg" type="audio/ogg"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio>

## Causes
Inexhaustive list.
- trying to get higher than is comfortable in M2
  - basically M2 screaming
- belting with bad technique
- yelling loud
- trying to artificially add vocal weight by pressed phonation (which is hyperadduction)

## Problems associated with hyperadduction
These mostly come about in the long term.
- nodules (you don't want this)
- general hoarseness when not hyperadducted
- voice pain
- loss of closure after being hyperadducted leading to breathiness

## Ways to avoid hyperadduction
- don't push the voice past the point of 'slightly fatiguing'
- make sure you aren't starving your voice of air and then using hyperadduction to get louder
- avoid vocal fry when going heavier in vocal weight

## If you have hyperadduction problems
1. stop training immediately
2. rest
3. do very light SOVTEs such as humming, to the point of failing to maintain phonation for at most 20 minutes a day until the hyperaduction habit is gone
4. learn your limits and stay mostly within them - don't push your voice to be loud or high in pitch, don't to belting
